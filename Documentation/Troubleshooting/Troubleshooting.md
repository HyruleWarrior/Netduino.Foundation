# Troubleshooting

## Error: Could Not Load Project

When loading a .NET Microframework project in Xamarin Studio, you may receive the following error:

![Could Not Load Project](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Labs-Robotics/blob/master/Getting%20Started/Images/Troubleshooting/Could_Not%20_Load_Project.png)

If you get this, then the add-in may have become disabled. To fix, open the **Xamarin Studio** menu > **Add-in Manager**, navigate to the add-in and clicke enable:

![Enable add-in](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Labs-Robotics/blob/master/Getting%20Started/Images/Troubleshooting/Enable_add-in.png)

This is a known issue and we're looking into a fix.
