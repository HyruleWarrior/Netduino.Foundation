# About

Netduino.Foundation has two sets of peripheral drivers; [built-in ones that cover common, generic, components](/API/CorePeripherals) that are built into the Netduino.Foundation core library, and the [specialized set of third party components](/Library) which are added via their individual Nuget packages.

The built-in peripherals are as follows:
