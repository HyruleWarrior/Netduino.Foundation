# Info

A quaternion is a vector containing four elements (`W`, `X`, `Y` and `Z`)  that can be used to represent a position in 3D space.  Quaternions have the advantage that, unlike Euler angles, they do not suffer from gimbal lock.

## Constructor

### `Quaternion(double w, double x, double y, double z)`

Create a new `Quaternion` object the with specified `w`, `x`, `y` and `z` values.

## Properties

### `double W`

`W` angle of the quaternion.

### `double X`

`X` angle of the quaternion.

### `double Y`

`Y` angle of the quaternion.

### `double Z`

`Z` angle of the quaternion.
